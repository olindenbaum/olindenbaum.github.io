    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect usage information. This doesn't tell us who a user is, though. It just lets us collect information about how people access and use our Services.

Here are a few examples of Usage Data: When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information about the type of device you're using, the operating system version on your device and your IP Address. Or if you're using the Site, we automatically collect information about your operating system, web browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), and your network-enabled machine's Internet Protocol (IP) address, as well as the pages you view, and the time and length of your visit. This data helps us analyze trends and user behaviors, manage the site, and enhance or update our Services.

    <h3>How We May Disclose Your Information</h3>
