    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>
        These terms and conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Mobile Application Developer ("Mobile
        Application Developer", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your"). This Agreement sets forth the
        general terms and conditions of your use of the CookAssist mobile application and any of its products or
        services (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services").</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3> Accounts and membership</h3>
    <p> If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your
        account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
        taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may
        sign in and use our Services. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of
        any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any
        part thereof) at any time.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>User content</h3>
    <p> We do not own any data, information or material ("Content") that you submit in the Mobile Application in the
        course of using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality,
        reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We
        may monitor and review Content in the Mobile Application submitted or created using our Services by you. Unless
        specifically permitted by you, your use of the Mobile Application does not grant us the license to use,
        reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for
        commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store,
        transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of
        providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right,
        though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
        opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. </p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>Prohibited uses</h3>

        its Content: (a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or participate in any unlawful acts;

        sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, race, age, national origin, or disability; (f) to submit false or
        misleading information; (g) to upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may
        be used in any way that will affect the functionality or operation of the Service or of any related mobile

        others; (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (j) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or

        related mobile application for violating any of the prohibited uses. </p>
